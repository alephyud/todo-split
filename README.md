# todo-split

generated using Luminus version "2.9.12.29"

This is an example Clojure / ClojureScript todo list app, built using
[Reagent][1] / [re-frame][2] / [Kee-Frame][3].

To make things more interesting, you can split any task into subtasks
by pressing the `S` key once you run the app.
You can also have a set of tasks generated for you
using Clojure Spec generators by pressing the `G` key.

The changes are persisted in the browser's local storage using
[re-frame-storage][4]
and have undo / redo enabled using [re-frame-undo][5].

## Running

To start a development Figwheel server for the application, run:

    lein figwheel app test
    
It also includes the web server.
After that, open `http://localhost:3000` for the application and
`http://localhost:3000/test` for frontend tests.
