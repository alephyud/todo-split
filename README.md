# todo-split

generated using Luminus version "2.9.12.29"

This is an example Clojure / ClojureScript todo list app, built using
[Reagent][1] / [re-frame][2] / [Kee-Frame][3].

You can view the live demo of the application
[here](https://todosplit.mydemoapps.net/).

Once you open the app, press <kbd>H</kbd> or click 'Help' for a
list of key bindings. You can split any task into subtasks
by pressing the <kbd>S</kbd> key.
You can also have a set of tasks generated for you
using Clojure Spec generators by pressing the <kbd>G</kbd> key.


The changes are persisted in the browser's local storage using
[re-frame-storage][4]
and have undo / redo enabled using [re-frame-undo][5].

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed. If you want to change
styles and non-CLJS scripts (including the Bootstrap build),
you will also need NPM.

## Development Setup

To start a development Figwheel server for the application, run:

    lein figwheel app test
    
It also includes the web server.
After that, open `http://localhost:3000` for the application and
`http://localhost:3000/test` for frontend tests.

Styles and non-CLJS scripts are built using [Gulp][1]. To start Gulp,
install the NPM dependencies:

    npm install --dev
    npm install gulp -g

and then run Gulp:

    gulp watch
